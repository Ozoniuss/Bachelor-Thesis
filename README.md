# Goal

The final goal of this project would be to enable easily creating, storing and configuring machine learning models, training them on advanced cloud hardware and benchmarking them agains other models. The following features are proposed:

- Downloading/Uploading certain machine learning models and feature vectors
- Adding a new head to a feature vector to perform a different task, either via uploading some configuration or making the configuration directly in the U.I.
- Attaching a dataset to train a model
- Training the new model obtained from the feature vector and the new output layer on the cloud
- Benchmarking the model on some dataset and displaying those benchmarks.
- Viewing a list of created or downloaded/uploaded models (and possibly a list of the datasets they were trained on as well as their benchmarks)
- Comparing two models that perform the same task through a benchmark

This is only a high-level overview of the list of features, I might update it in the future. Basically, it shall be simple to attach a new head to an existing model, train it to perform a new task, benchmark it and download it.
